Description:
As a user, I want to sort the product list by choosing a characteristic and order so that I can be able to choose better following my sort criteria.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am on the product list for the first time the page is sorted by position and has the descending order.
- Given I am in the product list when I click with my mouse the “sort by” dropdown control I can see there are 4 options: Position, product name, price, and new arrivals.
-  Given I am on the product list and I click on one of the sort options: Position, product name, price, and new arrivals, the list is sorted by the chosen option and the direction order.
- Given I am in the product list and I click on the direction order, if the icon arrow is up ↑
the list is sorted in descending order, if the icon arrow is down the list is sorted in ascending order.


After choosing the type of sort the page does the sort automatically? Or does the user have to press some button?
After choosing the sort, when the user waits for the correct order, the screen shows something in the meantime to the user to inform that the sort is in process?
